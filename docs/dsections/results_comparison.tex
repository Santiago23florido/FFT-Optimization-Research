\section{Benchmark Results and Comparison}

This section compares the implemented transform models using an automated benchmark and plotting workflow. The evaluated algorithms are \texttt{radix2\_iterative}, \texttt{radix2\_recursive}, and \texttt{direct\_dft}. The measured sizes are \(N\in\{64,128,256,512,1024\}\), with 3 warmup iterations and 20 measured iterations per pair \((\text{algorithm},N)\), using seed 1337.

The plotted quantities are extracted from the benchmark summary data:
\begin{itemize}
\item transform length \(N\);
\item average runtime per transform (microseconds);
\item throughput (processed samples per second).
\item Additional measured descriptors (not shown in the two figures below): median runtime, best-case runtime, worst-case runtime, runtime dispersion (standard deviation), tail latency at the 95th percentile, normalized runtime per sample, and normalized runtime per \(N\log_2 N\).
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:mean_runtime} shows the expected complexity separation. The \texttt{direct\_dft} curve grows much faster with \(N\), while both radix-2 implementations scale substantially better. In this benchmark run at \(N=1024\), mean runtime is approximately 16.65~\(\mu s\) for \texttt{radix2\_iterative}, 40.39~\(\mu s\) for \texttt{radix2\_recursive}, and 13,948.47~\(\mu s\) for \texttt{direct\_dft}.

Figure \ref{fig:throughput} presents the same comparison in throughput form. At \(N=1024\), measured throughput is about 61.5 million samples/s for \texttt{radix2\_iterative}, 25.4 million samples/s for \texttt{radix2\_recursive}, and 73.4 thousand samples/s for \texttt{direct\_dft}. This confirms that the iterative in-place radix-2 model is the strongest baseline among the tested implementations for desktop execution.

These results are consistent with the theoretical complexity analysis and provide a reproducible quantitative baseline for future algorithm extensions and microcontroller-oriented optimization.
