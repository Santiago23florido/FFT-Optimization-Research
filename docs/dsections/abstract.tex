This paper presents a correctness-first C++20 framework for implementing and evaluating multiple fast Fourier transform (FFT) kernels, including iterative radix-2, iterative mixed-radix (4/2), split-radix, and structure-of-arrays (SoA) layout-optimized variants. A mathematically exact \(O(N^2)\) DFT/IDFT reference is used as an independent oracle to validate each implementation. The verification workflow enforces bin-wise agreement with the direct transform, round-trip stability \(\mathrm{IFFT}(\mathrm{FFT}(x))\approx x\), pure-tone localization, and Parseval energy consistency under double precision. Beyond correctness, the framework provides reproducible benchmarking with robust timing statistics and derived throughput metrics. In the reported experiments (\(N=64\) to \(4096\), 40 iterations, 5 warmups), the best optimized kernel (\texttt{mixed42\_soa}) achieves up to \(3.61\times\) lower mean runtime than the baseline iterative radix-2 AoS implementation and a \(2.69\times\) average speedup for \(N\ge128\), with peak throughput of \(214.81\) million samples/s. The resulting project is a dependency-free and verifiable baseline for education, research prototyping, and performance-oriented spectral processing systems.
