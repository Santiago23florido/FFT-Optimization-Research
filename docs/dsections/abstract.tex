This paper presents a complete C++20 implementation of an iterative in-place radix-2 Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its inverse (IFFT), together with a mathematically exact \(O(N^2)\) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) reference for validation. The implementation follows a strict engineering sign convention, applies bit-reversal permutation, and includes explicit \(1/N\) normalization in the inverse transform. Verification is treated as a primary design objective: automated tests compare FFT output against the direct DFT, validate round-trip stability \(\mathrm{IFFT}(\mathrm{FFT}(x))\approx x\), check pure-tone spectral concentration, and enforce Parseval energy consistency under double precision. This approach yields a dependency-free and reproducible baseline suitable for research prototypes, educational signal-processing laboratories, and production-oriented systems where deterministic spectral behavior and explainable numerical error bounds are required.
